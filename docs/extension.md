# Extension

You can add additional logic using Gohan Extension.
Extensions has properties:

- id identity of the code
- code contents of a code
- code_type javascript, go and Gohan script (DSL) are supported
- URL placement of code. Currently, file://, http:// and https:// schemes are supported
- path resource path to execute code

Example Code

```
  extensions:
  - code: console.log(Object.keys(context));
    id: test
    path: /v2.0/.*
```

  id : request id

  context.response contains response data.
  You can also update response here

### post_list_in_transaction

  Same as post_list but executed in the DB transaction context.transaction contains transaction object for DB operation

  id : request id
  context.response contains response data.
  You can also update response here

### post_list

  list event after DB operation.

  context.response contains response data.

  Note you can skip DB operation if you set context response in here

### pre_show_in_transaction

  Same as pre_show but executed in the DB transaction context.transaction contains transaction object for DB operation

  id : request id
  context.response contains response data.
  You can also update response here

### post_show_in_transaction

  Same as post_show but executed in the DB transaction context.transaction contains transaction object for DB operation

  id : request id
  context.response contains response data.
  You can also update response here

### post_show

  show event after DB operation

  id : request id
  context.response contains response data.
  You can also update response here

### pre_create

  executed before creation
  Mainly used for validation purpose

  context.resource contains user input data

  Note you can skip DB operation if you set context response in here

### pre_create_in_transaction

  Same as pre_create but executed in the DB transaction context.transaction contains transaction object for DB operation

### post_create_in_transaction

  after creation in the transaction

### post_create

  after create
  context.response contains response data.
  context.transaction contains transaction object for db operation

### pre_update

  executed before an update
  Mainly used for validation purpose

  context.resource contains user input data

  Note you can skip DB operation if you set context response in here

### pre_update_in_transaction

  same as pre_update but executed in the db transaction
  context.transaction contains transaction object for db operation

### post_update_in_transaction

  after creation in transaction

### post_update

  after update
  context.response contains response data.
  context.transaction contains transaction object for db operation

### pre_delete

  executed before delete
  Mainly used for validation purpose

  context.id contains resource id we are trying to delete
  context.transaction contains transaction object for db operation

### pre_delete_in_transaction

  same as pre_delete but executed in the db transaction
  context.transaction contains transaction object for db operation

### post_delete_in_transaction

  after creation in transaction

### post_delete

  after delete

### pre_state_update_in_transaction

  executed before a state update triggered by a backend event

  context.resource contains the resource associated with the update,
  context.state contains the state changes,
  context.config_version contains the current config version

### post_state_update_in_transaction

  as above, but after the state update

### pre_monitoring_update_in_transaction

# Go extension

You can implement Gohan extension by native go.
You can use "go" for code_type and specify your callback id in code.
Also, you can register go struct & call it from javascript.

```
  extensions:
  - code: exampleapp_callback
    code_type: go
    id: example
    path: .*
```

```
  //Register go callback
  extension.RegisterGoCallback("exampleapp_callback",
  	func(event string, context map[string]interface{}) error {
  		fmt.Printf("callback on %s : %v", event, context)
  		return nil
  })
 ```

We have exampleapp with comments in exampleapp directory.
You can also, import github.com/cloudwan/server module and
have your own RunServer method to have whole custom route written in go.
