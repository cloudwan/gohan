# Extension

You can add additional logic using Gohan Extension.
Extensions has properties:

- id identity of the code
- code contents of a code
- code_type javascript and goext are supported
- URL placement of code. Currently, file://, http:// and https:// schemes are supported
- path resource path to execute code

Example Code

```yaml
  extensions:
  - code: console.log(Object.keys(context));
    id: test
    path: /v2.0/.*
```

Gohan supports two types of extensions:
- javascript
- golang (as a plugin, loadable at runtime) 

Comparison of different types of extensions:

| Name | type-id | language | execution performance | loadable at runtime |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| javascript | javascript | javascript | interpreted | yes |
| golang (plugin) | goext | golang | native | yes |

- schema - schema.Schema - schema defining given path
- schema_id - string - schema ID
- params - map[string]interface{} - HTTP request parameters
- sync - sync.Sync - Sync client
- DB - db.DB - DB client
- identity_service - middleware.IdentityService - identity service
- service_auth - schema.Authorization - Autorization object
